Kindle Publishing Service

Welcome to the Kindle Publishing Service! This project aims to automate the process of converting books into a digital format for the Kindle store, reducing the wait time for our customers to access new ebooks.

Overview
The service consists of several APIs that allow users to upload a book, convert it to the Kindle format, and publish it to the store. The architecture is designed to be scalable and fault-tolerant, using microservices and caching to handle high traffic.
